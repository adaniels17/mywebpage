    <!--BUS 118W Summary-->
    <h3>Course Summary</h3>
    <p>     BUS 118W is Web Based Computing and it is about the programming for web based applications. Web Based computing is a technology that enables a person to move his applications from 
        their storage to the internet. We will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and be implementing these into our websites. 
        The course teaches you how to design your own website and create other web applications and by the end we will have a fully functional website which will be our final project. We will learn how to launch and test our site using different softwares.

    <!--Lecture Review-->
    <ol>Lecture Review
        <p>The lecture is an overview of HTTP and concepts. It gives backstory on how hypertext and the innovation of HTTP requests
            and other things like URLs. There are also examples of web pages written in HTML and requests.
            They also explain the concepts of cookies and how they're used. Proxy Server and their caches are explained and a diagram
            is showed of a proxy server and how they connect clients to a server.
        </p>
        <li>I learned how cookies are used for serveres to remember previous information and how its accessed using a generated user ID.</li>
        <li>I liked learning about cookies because I never knew how they actually saved your information, but this gives me a lot clearer view on it.</li>
        <li>I suggest that the speaker uses a lot clearer diagrams and more pictures that are easy to read and explain the concept very well for visual learners. Some of the diagrams were a little hard to understand. </li>
